- Kafka, RabbitMQ  
- Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD  
- AWS & cloud-native architectures  
- Grafana, Prometheus  
- Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)

🌍 **What I Care About**  
- Writing clean, testable and maintainable code  
- Designing scalable backend architectures  
- Optimizing performance and reliability  
- Building meaningful software with real-world impact

📚 **Currently focused on**  
- Advanced system design patterns
